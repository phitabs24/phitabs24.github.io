Hi, I'm **Achu Philemon Tabufor**, a cybersecurity enthusiast dedicated to defending digital spaces through ethical practice and hands-on learning.  

I'm currently earning the [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity) and preparing for the CompTIA Security+ exam, while building practical skills in:

- Network analysis (Wireshark)
- Log analysis (Splunk)
- Offensive & defensive tools (Kali Linux, VMware)
- Python scripting for automation

I love turning theory into action‚Äîfrom dissecting network traffic to scripting small tools that can help spot risks. As I grow, I aim to specialize in **threat detection** and **incident response**, supporting organizations in staying secure and resilient.

This portfolio captures my journey through labs, CTFs, and real-world projects. Let‚Äôs build something secure together. üîêüíª
