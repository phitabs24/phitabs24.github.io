## 👥 Conversation-Style Interview: The Flow

**Interviewer:** *Let’s start light — what got you into cybersecurity?*  
**Me:** *Honestly, curiosity. Breaking stuff and figuring out how things work has always excited me. The moment I stumbled onto OverTheWire Bandit, I was hooked.*

**Interviewer:** *Nice. Let’s talk privilege escalation. You’re on a Linux box with limited access. What’s your strategy?*  
**Me:** *Check user groups, sudo privileges, SUID binaries, path variables… maybe run `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null` to find potential misconfigurations.*

**Interviewer:** *You just landed reverse shell access. What next?*  
**Me:** *Stabilize the shell (with Python TTY or Socat), enumerate the environment, validate persistence options — and of course, document every step.*

## 🧠 Beyond Technicals: What They’re Really Evaluating

- **Problem-solving logic**: Can you think and explain clearly under pressure?
- **Security hygiene**: Do you automate documentation? Use aliases and configs?
- **Real-world scenarios**: Have you faced a patch gap, broken auth flow, or sandbox escape?

## 🔍 Pro Tips for Chat-Style Interviews

- Be authentic — don’t script everything, let your curiosity lead.
- Walk through your thought process out loud.
- Use stories — like how you learned to pivot on Windsurf or debug Python in PyCharm.

## 🧭 Closing Thoughts

Technical interviews in cybersecurity often feel like pairing sessions — two minds poking at a mystery. If you treat it like a collaborative challenge, rather than a spotlight performance, you’ll not only survive... you’ll stand out.
